  <h1>Filing a Scheduled Process</h1>
  <small class="metadata">By Mike Schwartz | <time datetime="2019-02-17 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC">Feb 17, 2019</time></small>
  <p>For most shelf-stable fluid products, it is necessary to obtain a scheduled
process prior to producing the product.</p>
<p>A scheduled process is your recipe and procedure, which has been reviewed and
edited by a recognized process authority. With very few exceptions, if you are
making a product that is fluid and shelf-stable, you will be required to have a
scheduled process.</p>
<p>The FDA regulates the production of food and requires that the scheduled process
be registered with the FDA.</p>
<p>The links below will take you to some recognized process authorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food Science New England – Fred Jewett – <a href="mailto:fred.fsne@gmail.com">fred.fsne@gmail.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nelabsct.com/">NorthEast Labs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://foodscience.cals.cornell.edu/people/olga-padilla-zakour">Cornell University</a></li>
<li><a href="https://foodsciencehumannutrition.umaine.edu/food-technology/process-and-product-reviews/">University of Maine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To obtain a scheduled process, you must submit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your recipe. Each ingredient must be measured by weight (pounds, ounces,
grams, kilograms). Choose one unit of measure and stick with it</li>
<li>Your method. These are the production steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>The scheduled process is a formal document which must be followed exactly, by
you or by your co-packer.</p>
<p>You may do this yourself, or we can do it for you. The advantage of using our
services is that we have filed many processes and understand the pitfalls that
slow acceptance. We are normally able to have the process approved faster with
less difficulty than if you attempted to file the process yourself. We review
your process and offer suggestions to help speed you on your way to production.</p>
<p>It is to your advantage to streamline the process and allow for as many
variables as possible. For example, if you only make 5 fl oz bottles, but you
think in the future you may want to make half gallons, ask the process authority
to write it for “4 fl oz up to 128 fl oz”</p>
<p>You may also ask them to write statements such as “Water may be added to thin
the product to the correct consistency” or “Vinegar may be added to adjust pH”.
If it is not on the document, you are prohibited from making adjustments without
permission from the processing authorities.</p>
<p>It is also important for you to know how many gallons of product (this is a unit
of volume) or unit of product produced by this quantity.</p>
<p>The process authority will make adjustments to your recipe and procedure to
ensure that it can be safely stored at room temperature. This may include the
addition of acid, salt, sugar, or other additives to create the correct pH or
water activity.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid to question the additions if you think that it will change the
flavor or texture of the product. There may be other options.</p>
<p>Once you have your scheduled process, you are ready to go into production and
can safely make a shelf-stable product.</p>
<p>We at Organic Food Incubator would love to assist you in obtaining your
scheduled process. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> to get started.</p>
