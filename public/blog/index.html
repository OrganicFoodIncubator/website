      <p>You just came up with a brand new product. Now, you want to get it distributed
and produced on a large scale to send out to stores. Before you can do that you
need to determine if you need to get a scheduled process completed and if you do
need one, complete it. Most beverages, sauces, and condiments need a scheduled
process. What is a scheduled process?</p>

      <p>For many products, acidity is a very important aspect of development, as it can
help ensure shelf life stability. In small batches of food manufacturing, pH is
a critical factor enabling your product to be shelf-stable. pH is important for
food items as pathogenic bacteria cannot grow in a low pH environment.</p>

      <p>Is it important to be certified organic or kosher? Both of these certifications
have benefits but are often costly, so they are not suitable for all products.
However, having these certifications may open your product to new markets.</p>

      <p>Who is my target market? Identifying your target market is a crucial step in
creating a successful product. Often people producing a product will say that
their product is for everyone, but that is a mistake! Many different consumer
bases may purchase your product, but you will have a few core target markets or
target audiences that make up the bulk of your purchases. So–how do you figure
out who your target market is?</p>

      <p>Most products that OFI produces are shelf-stable, meaning that they do not need
to be refrigerated, and must be subjected to heat treatment to prevent the
growth of pathogens, primarily botulism. This heat treatment can offer shelf
stability for a long time.</p>

      <p>For most shelf-stable fluid products, it is necessary to obtain a scheduled
process prior to producing the product.</p>
<p>A scheduled process is your recipe and procedure, which has been reviewed and
edited by a recognized process authority. With very few exceptions, if you are
making a product that is fluid and shelf-stable, you will be required to have a
scheduled process.</p>
