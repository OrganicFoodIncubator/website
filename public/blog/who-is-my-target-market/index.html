  <p>Who is my target market? Identifying your target market is a crucial step in
creating a successful product. Often people producing a product will say that
their product is for everyone, but that is a mistake! Many different consumer
bases may purchase your product, but you will have a few core target markets or
target audiences that make up the bulk of your purchases. So–how do you figure
out who your target market is?</p>
<p>First, you must understand the need your product fills. What are the core
benefits your product has? Create a simple definition of your product and its
benefits.</p>
<p>Once you have a good idea of your product, research potential target markets.
There is a lot of free and available for purchase market research online.
Analyze each group’s values, priorities, and the other types of products they
purchase. Who are influencers to these groups? Do they value Organic or Kosher
certification? How is your product differentiated from the other products they
purchase? Although you can research your targets infinitely, spend some time
getting a better idea of the groups you want to focus on.</p>
<p>Once you figure out your key market you can use that information to shape your
product in a way that highlights the benefits those groups see as priorities.
You can use marketing in the areas that most likely to reach those consumer
groups. A better understanding of your target market can transform your product
from a good idea to a huge success!</p>
