  <h1>Intro To Product Shelf Life Stability And Acidity</h1>

  <p>For many products, acidity is a very important aspect of development, as it can
help ensure shelf life stability. In small batches of food manufacturing, pH is
a critical factor enabling your product to be shelf-stable. pH is important for
food items as pathogenic bacteria cannot grow in a low pH environment.</p>
<p>The pH scale is a 14-point reference scale from 0 to 14, where 0 is the most
acidic and 14 is the most alkaline. 7 is considered neutral with acidic below
that value and alkaline above. Most microbes prefer a neutral or near-neutral
environment. It is measured with a pH meter. There are many types of pH meters,
but generally, a digital unit with a probe is more accurate. They can cost $250
or more, but a good meter is worth the investment. The meter must be calibrated
frequently to give accurate measurements and requires buffering liquid for this
procedure. This equipment can be purchased from a reputable company such as Cole
Parmer.</p>
<p>Each bacteria has a different acidity threshold that will kill it. The most
dangerous pathogen as far as shelf stability is concerned is Clostridium
botulinum (botulism) which cannot grow below a pH of 4.5. As a reference,
vinegar and lemon juice have an approximate pH of 2. Tomatoes have an
approximate pH of 4 and most vegetables have a pH between 6 and 7, which is
close to neutral. In contrast, soapy water has a pH of approximately 12, which
is alkaline. Ingredients with a low pH are sour and any additions of acid –
lactic, malic, citric, vinegar, lemon juice, or any other acids – will make your
product tarter.</p>
<p>To be safely packed, your product’s pH generally is used in conjunction with
temperature to prevent the possibility of mold or pathogen growth. When used
together and evaluated by a recognized process authority, your product may be
stored at ambient temperatures and will be safe for an extended time. This can
be done without the addition of dangerous chemicals.</p>
<p>This type of control is essential to ensure that your product is safely
manufactured, will have a long shelf life stability, and will be safe for your
customers.</p>
