  <h1>Margins And Costs | Where Is Your Profit?</h1>

  <p>When we are talking about margins and costs relating to the food manufacturing
industry, you need to know some basic information. Perhaps the most important
information is what portion of the money earned from your product you’ll
actually be making!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you do not get to take home your retail price. Before you see a
profit, the grocer’s margin is deducted, the distributor’s margin is deducted
and your costs are deducted. The amount that is remaining is your profit.</p>
<p>Grocer’s margins are a percentage of the retail price, which can be up to 40%.</p>
<p>Distributor’s margins are a percentage of the grocer’s cost, sometimes up to 35%</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Category</th>
<th>Amount</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Retail Price</td>
<td>$10.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grocer Margin</td>
<td>$4.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grocer Cost</td>
<td>$6.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Distributor Margin</td>
<td>$2.10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Proceeds to Entrepeneur</td>
<td>$3.90</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Your profit is the difference between ALL of your costs and selling price.</p>
<p>Your costs can include ingredients, packaging, and labor. These are the cost of
goods sold. In addition, your costs can also include marketing, insurance,
social media promotion, setting up/maintaining your website, product
transportation, utilities, and more. Before launching your product, consider all
of the factors that will affect your profit and your margins.</p>
