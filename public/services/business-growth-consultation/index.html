  <p>Our team can get you on the right track so that your business can grow, creating
new products, marketing, and making a return on your hard work.</p>
<p>As more small businesses enter the food and beverage manufacturing industry, the
options available to us are constantly growing and changing. Coaching at the
Organic Food Incubator provides startup and growth food business with tools to

<ul>
<li>Budgets</li>
<li>Costing</li>
<li>Margin</li>
<li>Nutritional values and labeling</li>
<li>Organic certification and compliance</li>

<p>The goal of our coaching program is to help you help yourself and learn the ins
and outs of manufacturing options. We will help you find the answers you need.
We act as a non-stakeholding business partner, offering suggestions and guidance
as your company grows. We will help keep you focused, organized and on track.
Our coaches will open doors that were closed to our own small food business when
we started.</p>
