  <p>Here at OFI Courses, we love to educate startups, entrepreneurs, restaurant
owners, and all forms of small businesses about the fantastic world of the food
industry. You can expect to learn food safety practices, product development
tactics, and food production processes. We have two options for how to learn
with us- a self-paced course and webinars, which are presented live and recorded
so that they can be watched on-demand. In addition, our blog has a wealth of
information about food production.</p>
<h2 id="self-paced-courses">Self-Paced Courses</h2>
<p>Once you have a food or beverage recipe that you would like to turn into a
product and sell, you need to have your recipe reviewed by a food scientist to
get the proper food safety documentation, called a “scheduled process”. This
will tell you or your manufacturer how to make your product safe for
distribution. To get a scheduled process, you have to complete some very
specific tasks and procedures. This course will teach you how to most
effectively navigate this process.
