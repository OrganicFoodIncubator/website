OFI Building Community

OFI’s Bloomfield New Jersey home is in a mixed use, primarily residential neighborhood about ten miles west of New York City. We have many relationships in the surrounding communities, business and personal, that we enjoy and bring purpose to our daily lives. The two that we are most proud of are the Deron School in Montclair New Jersey and Westside High School in Newark New Jersey. We elevate each other with our collaboration.

West Side High School

Principal Akbar Cook and some like minded school alumni reached out to OFI as a natural next step after building and farming raised beds to grow food for their local community. West Side High Principal Cook Received $100,000 from Ellen Degeneres to honor his dedication to his students and unique insights on how best to help the whole student. OFI and WSHS teamed up to bring the full entrepreneurial experience to some exceptional students. They grew the peppers, cooked, Bottled, labeled and sold red and green “Rider Heat” hot sauce.
