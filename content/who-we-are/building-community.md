## OFI Building Community

OFI’s Bloomfield New Jersey home is in a mixed use, primarily residential neighborhood about ten miles west of New York City. We have many relationships in the surrounding communities, business and personal, that we enjoy and bring purpose to our daily lives. The two that we are most proud of are the Deron School in Montclair New Jersey and Westside High School in Newark New Jersey. We elevate each other when we collaborate.
