OFI’s Bloomfield New Jersey home is in a mixed use, primarily residential neighborhood about ten miles west of New York City. We have many relationships in the surrounding communities, business and personal, that we enjoy and bring purpose to our daily lives. The two that we are most proud of are the Deron School in Montclair New Jersey and Westside High School in Newark New Jersey. We elevate each other when we collaborate.

## Commitment to Our Values

# The Deron School

The [Deron School](https://www.deronschool.org/) has an active teacher supervised participatory learning presence at our facility most days of the school year. The students do meaningful work each day and acquire skills and confidence. 

With campuses in Union, NJ and Montclair, NJ, The Deron School offers a state-approved private school program for students with multiple disabilities including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and down syndrome. Since 1967, The Deron School has provided a nurturing environment, family culture, and personalized curriculum to help students reach their greatest potential.
