**Motivation**

Why do I do what I do? 

Honestly, I love to see people grow. I want to help people become the best version of themselves. I believe it is helping me to score points with the big guy upstairs. I remember when I was first starting out and was not sure of my future, my mother’s colleague David Shuma from the Plaza Hotel in NYC told me he thought I would be great at Hospitality. It was the first time someone besides my parents ever told me I could be great at something! It ignited my interest in pursuing the opportunity. If he would have told me that he thought I could be a great plumber, I probably would be a plumber today.  That’s how strongly I feel I was easily  influenced by people’s opinion back then. I just didn't know any better.  

I chose to believe in what David  expressed to me and he ended up taking my mom and  I to experience the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park.  The school changed my destiny.  I was studying accounting at Nassau  Community  College in Long Island at the time of the visit. When I saw the environment at The Culinary Institute of America, I left accounting and went on to study Culinary Arts. 

What I learned from my own experience is, everyone has the potential to be great. Not everyone has a David Shuma in their lives that could help them find their way to being great.  After such a blessed career and experiences throughout, I chose to help members of the teams I work with to develop their skills and help them become a greater version of themselves. Everybody wins!  It’s always about the trilogy!  I feel the choices we make as leaders should always take into account how it will impact the 3 C’s.  Customer, Company  and Colleague!  Our choices should always benefit all three!

**Thank you Robert for all you do!**
