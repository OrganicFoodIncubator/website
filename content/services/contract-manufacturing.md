### Co-Packing

OFI's co-packing solution involves our handling only the packaging aspect of the production process. You provide their pre-manufactured products, and our team packages these products under the company’s label. This is ideal for companies that handle the manufacturing part themselves but need OFI’s additional resources or expertise to scale up their packaging efforts efficiently.

Our co-packing services provide a seamless solution for companies looking to bring their organic or conventional food products to market efficiently and effectively. We specialize in small-to-medium production runs, perfect for businesses at any stage—from startups to established brands looking to expand their product offerings. Our comprehensive co-packing solution includes everything from ingredient sourcing and formulation to processing, packaging, and labeling, all compliant with the highest quality standards. We pride ourselves on our ability to adapt to the unique needs of our clients, offering flexible production capabilities and meticulous quality control to ensure that each product we handle meets your specifications and consumer expectations.

Our private label program is designed to empower your brand with the tools and expertise needed to launch a successful CPG food line, from concept development to final production. Partner with us to leverage our infrastructure and expertise, reduce your go-to-market time, and captivate your audience with premium food and beverage offerings that reflect your brand’s commitment to quality and sustainability.

We care about your success and have experience with hundreds of businesses walking the path from nascent idea to a thriving product in the marketplace. Our equipment and facilities are designed to enable maximum flexibility to suit the widest possible range of products. OFI has had zero employee attrition over the past two years, so your product will be made by the same team whether you produce weekly or once a year.
