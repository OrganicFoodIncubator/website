For many products, acidity is a very important aspect of development, as it can
help ensure shelf life stability. In small batches of food manufacturing, pH is
a critical factor enabling your product to be shelf-stable. pH is important for
food items as pathogenic bacteria cannot grow in a low pH environment.

The pH scale is a 14-point reference scale from 0 to 14, where 0 is the most
acidic and 14 is the most alkaline. 7 is considered neutral with acidic below
that value and alkaline above. Most microbes prefer a neutral or near-neutral
environment. It is measured with a pH meter. There are many types of pH meters,
but generally, a digital unit with a probe is more accurate. They can cost $250
or more, but a good meter is worth the investment. The meter must be calibrated
frequently to give accurate measurements and requires buffering liquid for this
procedure. This equipment can be purchased from a reputable company such as Cole
Parmer.

Each bacteria has a different acidity threshold that will kill it. The most
dangerous pathogen as far as shelf stability is concerned is Clostridium
botulinum (botulism) which cannot grow below a pH of 4.5. As a reference,
vinegar and lemon juice have an approximate pH of 2. Tomatoes have an
approximate pH of 4 and most vegetables have a pH between 6 and 7, which is
close to neutral. In contrast, soapy water has a pH of approximately 12, which
is alkaline. Ingredients with a low pH are sour and any additions of acid –
lactic, malic, citric, vinegar, lemon juice, or any other acids – will make your
product tarter.

To be safely packed, your product’s pH generally is used in conjunction with
temperature to prevent the possibility of mold or pathogen growth. When used
together and evaluated by a recognized process authority, your product may be
stored at ambient temperatures and will be safe for an extended time. This can
be done without the addition of dangerous chemicals.

This type of control is essential to ensure that your product is safely
manufactured, will have a long shelf life stability, and will be safe for your
customers.
