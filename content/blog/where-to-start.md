Where To Start? How To Start Producing And Selling Your Product!

You have an incredible product, everyone tells you so. And now you want to produce and sell. We would love to helpâ€“but before we do, here are some steps to streamline the process:

Know your product- Understand the measurements and ingredients needed to make your product. Understand what your options are for wholesale ingredients and the most cost-effective way to store and purchase them. If possible, come prepared with a scheduled process. If you do not have one already, the OFI provides services to create one for your product.

Equipment Needs- Research the types of industrial machinery needed to make and package your product. Every CPG (Consumer Packaged Good) product requires specialized machinery. If you can learn what that machinery is and even better how much it costs, you will be steps ahead.

Packaging Needs- Product packaging needs may differ. When choosing the packaging it is important to think about maintaining flavor, freshness, product shape, and if production will affect the package (i.e. heat or freezing product).

Timeline- Have a timeline of your production expectations. Is this the first time you are producing this product? Do you want a trial run? How often do you plan to produce?

Licensing and Insurance- Make sure you have the licensing and insurance you need to produce your product. You will need product liability insurance. The least expensive option is FLIP Insurance. In order to obtain insurance you will need to provide your business filing, either as a sole proprietorship, LLC or Corporation as well as your EIN (Employer Identification Number).

Once you have accomplished this, you are ready to find a co-manufacturer like the OFI or go into production yourself with the addition of a Food Manufacturer's License.
